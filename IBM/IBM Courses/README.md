 ## Practical introduction to quantum-safe cryptography
 - Practical introduction to quantum-safe cryptography is a free online course on the IBM Quantum Learning platform and serves as a primer on the foundational concepts in quantum-safe cryptography.
- This course was created for developers who are interested in modernizing their application security and features multimodal lessons and interactive live code examples in four core areas of cryptography: cryptographic hash functions, symmetric key cryptography, asymmetric key cryptography, and quantum-safe cryptography.

- By taking this course, developers will learn how the cybersecurity risk landscape is evolving in the quantum era and steps they can take today to mitigate at-risk cryptography within their applications.
